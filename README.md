# Svelte (TypeScript) + Tailwind 3 App template

## Install

Pull the repo using `npx degit jkrooncoding/svelte-ts-tailwind`, change into the new directory and install the required packages by running either `yarn` or `npm install`. After installation, run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to spin up the app. If the packages are installed correctly you can head to `localhost:5000` and see your app running. Happy coding!

### Changing the default background color

To change the app's background color, head into _./src/App.svelte_ and either delete or change the _bg-slate-900_ class on the main HTML element.
